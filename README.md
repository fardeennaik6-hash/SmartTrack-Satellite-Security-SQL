# 🛰️ SmartTrack: Satellite Security Analysis with SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

**SmartTrack** is a SQL-based analytical project focused on monitoring and analyzing **satellite security data**.
The project leverages **structured query language (SQL)** to uncover security threats, anomalies, and operational insights from satellite tracking and monitoring datasets.

This project demonstrates strong skills in **data analysis, SQL querying, and security-focused analytics**, aligned with real-world space and defense use cases.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Satellite systems are critical assets and require continuous monitoring to:

* Detect potential security threats
* Identify abnormal satellite behavior
* Monitor mission status and failures
* Support data-driven security decisions

The challenge is to transform **raw satellite telemetry and security logs** into **actionable intelligence** using SQL.

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

* Analyze satellite activity and security events
* Identify high-risk satellites and zones
* Detect anomalies and irregular patterns
* Generate insights for proactive security monitoring

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – adaptable)
* Relational Database Concepts
* Joins, Subqueries, CTEs
* Window Functions
* Aggregations & Filtering
* Data Cleaning using SQL

## 🗃️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes simulated/realistic satellite security records such as:

* Satellite ID and type
* Orbit category
* Location / region
* Signal strength
* Event timestamps
* Security alerts and threat levels
* Operational status

> ⚠️ Note: Sensitive or classified data has been anonymized or simulated for educational purposes.

## 🔑 Key Analysis Performed

* Satellites with **highest number of security alerts**
* Region-wise **threat distribution**
* Detection of **abnormal signal patterns**
* Mission status and failure rate analysis
* Time-based trend analysis of security events

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

* Certain orbital regions show **higher frequency of security anomalies**
* Communication satellites face **more signal interference alerts**
* Repeated alert patterns indicate **potential system vulnerabilities**
* Some satellites show abnormal behavior during specific time windows
